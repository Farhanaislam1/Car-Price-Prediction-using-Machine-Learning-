# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning
# 📊 Project Overview
## This project focuses on predicting car prices using various machine learning models. Using a dataset from Kaggle, the goal is to understand how different features such as brand, engine size, mileage, and more influence car prices. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and regression techniques, we identify the best-performing model for accurate price prediction.

# 📁 Dataset
## The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle:
🔗 Kaggle Car Dataset

It contains specifications for a wide variety of cars, ranging from high-end brands like Bugatti and Lamborghini to more affordable ones like Toyota, Ford, and Honda.

# 🔍 Project Objectives
Analyze and clean the dataset

Visualize feature relationships with car price

Apply multiple regression models

Evaluate model performance using MAE and MSE

Select the best model for car price prediction

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – data processing

Seaborn, Matplotlib – data visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning models

Jupyter Notebook – analysis and development

# 📈 Machine Learning Models Applied
Linear Regression

Support Vector Regressor

K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor

PLS Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

MLP (Neural Network) Regressor

Each model’s predictions are visualized using regplots, and performance is compared using barplots of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
